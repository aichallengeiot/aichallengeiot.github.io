## Deep Neural Network Services for IoT Applications 
Keynote speech by [Tarek Abdelzaher](http://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

**Abstract**: The talk discusses a suite of machine learning and inference services designed to endow simple embedded devices (the clients of the service) with the appearance of intelligent behavior. Much of the talk offers answers to the followingquestions: How much of the AI workflow can be done on the resource-limited and power-limited end-devices themselves? How to efficiently delegate the rest to a remote service? Short of understanding laws of nature, can neural networks be made more efficientat learning from sensor data that reflects processes in the physical world? Finally, with the emergence of safety-critical applications, such as autonomous cars, is the current AI workflow adequate to meet priority and criticality needs of such applications? Examples and evaluation results are also presented.
