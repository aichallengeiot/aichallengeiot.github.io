The **First International Workshop on Challenges in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Internet of Things** will be held in conjunction with [ACM SenSys 2019](http://sensys.acm.org/2019/) on November 10-13, 2019 in New York, NY, USA.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are key enabling technologies for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the collection and processing of data for AI and ML is very challenging in the IoT domain. For example, there are usually a large number of low-powered sensors deployed in large geographical areas with possibly intermittent network connectivity. The sensors and their collected data may be owned by different users or organizations, which can bring further obstacles to data collection due to privacy concerns and noisy labels provided by different users. The successful application of AI/ML approaches in such scenarios with noisy and decentralized data is difficult. In addition, the amount of collected data that can be used for training AI/ML models is usually proportional to the number of users in the system, but the system may not be able to attract many users without a well-trained AI/ML model, and it is challenging to solve this dilemma.

This workshop focuses on how to address the above and other unique challenges of applying AI/ML in IoT systems. We invite researchers and practitioners to submit *papers describing original work, experiences, or vision* related to the entire lifecycle of an IoT system powered by AI and ML, including (but not limited to) the following topics:
- Algorithms and techniques for making use of data collected by geographically dispersed sensors to provide useful services through AI/ML
- Algorithms and techniques for sharing data and training AI/ML models while preserving user sensitive information
- Algorithms and techniques for reducing human effort in data labeling (such as active learning)
- Algorithms and techniques for evolving from a new system that is initially trained with only a small amount of data
- AI/ML with noisy data and labels
- AI/ML in multi-agent, distributed, and decentralized settings
- AI/ML with low-powered and/or intermittently connected devices
- Design and implementation of AI/ML-powered IoT systems

Papers focusing on specific IoT applications and generic IoT systems are both welcome.

Submissions should be up to 6 pages, in double column ACM proceeding format. The ACM template is available at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Submitted papers will be reviewed by a program committee for novelty, relevance, and quality.
